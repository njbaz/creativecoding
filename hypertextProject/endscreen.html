<p><strong>This interactive poem building space is inspired by and makes direct reference to American poet e.e. cummings (1884-1962). </strong> </p>
<br>
<p><strong>cummings is renowned for his unique and innovative style of poetry, characterized by unconventional use of grammar, punctuation, and syntax. He often experimented with structure, form, and typography, breaking traditional literary norms. His poems are known for their distinct lack of capitalization and unusual line breaks, showcasing a sense of spontaneity and playfulness.
</strong> </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>This project pulls from a database of individual lines from 35 poems (all source material can be examined <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHYL7yXlQ1EOEiTHmlsvLKaToy99_T-Vg2wkJVV9Zpw/edit#gid=87991345" target="_blank" style="color:white;">here</a>) and regenerates a new random selection of 100 lines of poetry to explore in the poem space with each page load. The overwhelming design of the poem space intentionally mimics the boundary-crossing approach that cummings took in his work.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Throughout his literary career, e.e. cummings explored themes such as love, nature, individualism, and the human experience. His works often celebrated the beauty and complexity of everyday life, while also challenging societal conventions and exploring the depths of human emotion. However, the format of his work requires most readers to dig deeper for meaning. This project examines the relationship that readers bring to cummings' works by challenging viewers to select lines that resonate with them from a random selection, then derive meaning from their specially created e.e. cummings-derived poem. </strong></p>
<br>
<p><strong>cummings' influence on modernist poetry is substantial, and he remains an iconic figure in American literature. e.e. cummings' innovative approach to language and form continues to inspire poets and readers, encouraging them to think beyond conventional boundaries and explore new avenues of creativity. This project seeked to contribute to and honor the impact cummings had on modern poetry and provide a thought-provoking experience for viewer.</strong> </p>
