i carry your heart with me (i carry it in
my heart) i am never without it (anywhere
"i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done"
"by only me is your doing, my darling)"
i fear
"no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want"
"no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)"
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you
here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows
higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)
i like my body when it is with your
body. It is so quite new a thing.
Muscles better and nerves more.
"i like your body. i like what it does,"
i like its hows. i like to feel the spine
"of your body and its bones, and the trembling"
-firm-smooth ness and which i will
again and again and again
"kiss, i like kissing this and that of you,"
"i like, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz"
"of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes"
"over parting flesh… And eyes big love-crumbs,"
and possibly i like the thrill
of under me you so quite new

maggie and milly and molly and may
went down to the beach (to play one day)
and maggie discovered a shell that sang
"so sweetly she couldn’t remember her troubles,and"
milly befriended a stranded star
whose rays five languid fingers were;
and molly was chased by a horrible thing
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles: and
may came home with a smooth round stone
as small as a world and as large as alone.
For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)
it’s always ourselves we find in the sea
anyone lived in a pretty how town
(with up so floating many bells down)
spring summer autumn winter
he sang his didn't he danced his did.
Women and men (both little and small)
cared for anyone not at all
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same
sun moon stars rain
children guessed (but only a few
and down they forgot as up they grew
autumn winter spring summer)
that noone loved him more by more
when by now and tree by leaf
she laughed his joy she cried his grief
bird by snow and stir by still
anyone's any was all to her
someones married their everyones
laughed their cryings and did their dance
(sleep wake hope and then)they
said their nevers they slept their dream
stars rain sun moon
(and only the snow can begin to explain
how children are apt to forget to remember
with up so floating many bells down)
one day anyone died i guess
(and noone stooped to kiss his face)
busy folk buried them side by side
little by little and was by was
all by all and deep by deep
and more by more they dream their sleep
noone and anyone earth by april
with by spirit and if by yes.
Women and men (both dong and ding)
summer autumn winter spring
reaped their sowing and went their came
sun moon stars rain
"somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond"
"any experience,your eyes have their silence:"
"in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,"
or which i cannot touch because they are too near
your slightest look easily will unclose me
"though i have closed myself as fingers,"
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
"(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose"
"or if your wish be to close me,i and"
"my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,"
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
"compels me with the color of its countries,"
rendering death and forever with each breathing
(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens;only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
"nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands"
"If freckles were lovely, and day was night,"
"And measles were nice and a lie warn't a lie,"
"Life would be delight,-"
But things couldn't go right
For in such a sad plight
I wouldn't be I.
"If earth was heaven, and now was hence,"
"And past was present, and false was true,"
There might be some sense
But I'd be in suspense
For on such a pretense
You wouldn't be you.
"If fear was plucky, and globes were square,"
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
"Things would seem fair,-"
"Yet they'd all despair,"
For if here was there
We wouldn't be we.

it may not always be so; and i say
"that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch"
"another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch"
"his heart, as mine in time not far away;"
if on another's face your sweet hair lay
"in such a silence as i know, or such"
"great writhing words as, uttering overmuch,"
stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;
"if this should be, i say if this should be —"
"you of my heart, send me a little word;"
"that i may go unto him, and take his hands,"
"saying, Accept all happiness from me."
"Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird"
sing terribly afar in the lost lands.
“next to of course god america i
love you land of the pilgrims’ and so forth oh

with such a silence and such a darkness

(except my life)the true time of year-
and if what calls itself a world should have
the luck to hear such singing(or glimpse such
sunlight as will leap higher than high
through gayer than gayest someone's heart at your each

it is at moments after i have dreamed
"of the rare entertainment of your eyes,"
when(being fool to fancy)i have deemed
with your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;
at moments when the glassy darkness holds
the genuine apparition of your smile
(it was through tears always)and silence moulds
such strangeness as was mine a little while;
moments when my once more illustrious arms
"are filled with fascination,when my breast"
wears the intolerant brightness of your charms:
one pierced moment whiter than the rest
-turning from the tremendous lie of sleep
i watch the roses of the day grow deep.

(2 little ams
and over them this
aflame with dreams
incredible is)
i thank You God for most this amazing
day:for the leaping greenly spirits of trees
and a blue true dream of sky;and for everything
which is natural which is infinite which is yes
"(i who have died am alive again today,"
and this is the sun's birthday;this is the birth
day of life and love and wings:and of the gay
great happening illimitably earth)
how should tasting touching hearing seeing
breathing any-lifted from the no
of all nothing-human merely being
doubt unimaginable You?
(now the ears of my ears awake and
now the eyes of my eyes are opened)
what if a much of a which of a wind
gives the truth to summer's lie;
bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun
and yanks immortal stars awry?
Blow king to beggar and queen to seem
(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time)
"-when skies are hanged and oceans drowned,"
the single secret will still be man
what if a keen of a lean wind flays
screaming hills with sleet and snow:
strangles valleys by ropes of thing
and stifles forests in white ago?
Blow hope to terror; blow seeing to blind
(blow pity to envy and soul to mind)
"-whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees,"
it's they shall cry hello to the spring
what if a dawn of a doom of a dream
"bites this universe in two,"
peels forever out of his grave
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you?
Blow soon to never and never to twice
(blow life to isn't:blow death to was)
-all nothing's only our hugest home;
"the most who die, the more we live"
a man who had fallen among thieves
lay by the roadside on his back
dressed in fifteenthrate ideas
wearing a round jeer for a hat
fate per a somewhat more than less
emancipated evening
had in return for consciousness
endowed him with a changeless grin
whereon a dozen staunch and leal
citizens did graze at pause
then fired by hypercivic zeal
sought newer pastures or because
swaddled with a frozen brook
of pinkest vomit out of eyes
which noticed nobody he looked
as if he did not care to rise
one hand did nothing on the vest
its wideflung friend clenched weakly dirt
while the mute trouserfly confessed
a button solemnly inert.
Brushing from whom the stiffened puke
i put him all into my arms
and staggered banged with terror through
a million billion trillion stars
in time of daffodils(who know
the goal of living is to grow)
"forgetting why,remember how"
in time of lilacs who proclaim
"the aim of waking is to dream,"
remember so(forgetting seem)
in time of roses(who amaze
our now and here with paradise)
"forgetting if,remember yes"
in time of all sweet things beyond
"whatever mind may comprehend,"
remember seek(forgetting find)
and in a mystery to be
(when time from time shall set us free)
"forgetting me,remember me"

All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the merry deer ran before.
Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
the swift red deer
the red rare deer.
Four red roebuck at a white water
the cruel bugle sang before.
Horn at hip went my love riding
riding the echo down
into the silver dawn.
four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the level meadows ran before.
Softer be they than slippered sleep
the lean lithe deer
the fleet flown deer.
Four fleet does at a gold valley
the famished arrow sang before.
Bow at belt went my love riding
riding the mountain down
into the silver dawn.
four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the sheer peaks ran before.
Paler be they than daunting death
the sleek slim deer
the tall tense deer.
Four tall stags at the green mountain
the lucky hunter sang before.
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
my heart fell dead before.
my love
thy hair is one kingdom
the king whereof is darkness
thy forehead is a flight of flowers
thy head is a quick forest
filled with sleeping birds
thy breasts are swarms of white bees
upon the bough of thy body
thy body to me is April
in those armpits is the approach of spring
thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot
of kings
they are the striking of a good minstrel
between them is always a pleasant song
my love
thy head is a casket
of the cool jewel of thy mind
the hair of thy head is one warrior
innocent of defeat
thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army
with victory and with trumpets
thy legs are the trees of dreaming
whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness
thy lips are satraps in scarlet
in whose kiss is the combinings of kings
thy wrists
are holy
which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood
thy feet upon thy ankles are flowers in vases
of silver
in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes
thy eyes are the betrayal
of bells comprehended through incense
when serpents bargain for the right to squirm
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage -
when thorns regard their roses with alarm
and rainbows are insured against old age
when every thrush may sing no new moon in
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice
- and any wave signs on the dotted line
or else an ocean is compelled to close
when the oak begs permission of the birch
to make an acorn - valleys accuse their
mountains of having altitude - and march
denounces april as a saboteur
then we'll believe in that incredible
unanimal mankind (and not until)
"pity this busy monster, manunkind,"
not. Progress is a comfortable disease:
your victim (death and life safely beyond)
plays with the bigness of his littleness
—- electrons deify one razorblade
into a mountainrange; lenses extend
unwish through curving wherewhen till unwish
returns on its unself.
A world of made
is not a world of born —- pity poor flesh
"and trees, poor stars and stones, but never this"
fine specimen of hypermagical
ultraomnipotence. We doctors know
a hopeless case if —- listen: there's a hell
of a good universe next door; let's go
if everything happens that can't be done
(and anything's righter
than books

the stupidest teacher will almost guess
(with a run

can be)

there's somebody calling who's we
we're anything brighter than even the sun

Seeing how the limp huddling string
of your smile over his body squirms
"kissingly, I will bring you every spring"
handfuls of little normal worms.
"Dress deftly your flesh in stupid stuffs,"
phrase the immense weapon of your hair.
"Understanding why his eye laughs,"
I will bring you every year
"something which is worth the whole,"
an inch of nothing for your soul.
because i love you)last night
clothed in sealace
appeared to me
your mind drifting
with chuckling rubbish
of pearl weed coral and stones;
"lifted,and(before my"
"eyes sinking)inward,fled;softly"
your face smile breasts gargled
by death rowned only
again carefully through deepness to rise
these your wrists
thighs feet hands
poising
to again utterly disappear;
rushing gently swiftly creeping
through my dreams last
"night,all of your"
body with its spirit floated
(clothed only in
the tide's acute weaving murmur
"Stand forth,John Keats! On earth thou knew'st me not;"
"Steadfast through all the storms of passion,thou,"
"True to thy muse,and virgin to thy vow;"
"Resigned,if name with ashes were forgot,"
So thou one arrow in the gold had'st shot!
"I never placed my laurel on thy brow,"
"But on thy name I come to lay it now,"
When thy bones wither in the earthly plot.
"Fame is my name. I dwell among the clouds,"
"Being immortal,and the wreath I bring"
Itself is Immortality. The sweets
"Of earth I know not,more the pains,but wing"
"In mine own ether,with the crownéd crowds"
"Born of the centuries.-Stand forth,John Keats!"
"Jehovah buried,Satan dead,"
do fearers worship Much and Quick;
"badness not being felt as bad,"
itself thinks goodness what is meek;
"obey says toc,submit says tic,"
Eternity's a Five Year Plan:
if Joy with Pain shall hand in hock
who dares to call himself a man?
"go dreamless knaves on Shadows fed,"
"your Harry's Tom,your Tom is Dick;"
"while Gadgets murder squack and add,"
the cult of Same is all the chic;
"by instruments,both span and spic,"
are justly measured Spic and Span:
to kiss the mike if Jew turn kike
who dares to call himself a man?
"loudly for Truth have liars pled,click;"
"where Boobs are holy,poets mad,"
illustrious punks of Progress shriek;
"when Souls are outlawed,Hearts are sick,"
"Hearts being sick,Minds nothing can:"
if Hate's a game and Love's a fuck
who dares to call himself a man?
"King Christ,this world is all aleak;"
and lifepreservers there are none:
and waves which only He may walk
Who dares to call Himself a man.
